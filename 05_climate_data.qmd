# Getting Started with Climate Data

This sections introduces you to the basics of using `Climate Data Operators (CDO)` to efficiently manipulate and analyze `netCDF` files, which are commonly used for storing climate data. `CDO` is a powerful command-line toolset designed to handle several climate data formats, allowing you to perform tasks such as data conversion, averaging, regridding, etc.

[More info go directly to the Max Planck Institute CDO website](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/)

## `CDO` Installation Process

### **MacOS**

Follow the instruction and downloaded **MacPorts**. **MacPorts** is an open-source community initiative to design an easy-to-use system for compiling, installing, and upgrading the command-line on the Mac operating system.

**1. Enable Windows Subsystem for `Linux (WSL)`:**

-   Open `PowerShell` as Administrator and run:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
wsl --install
```

-   This command installs the `Windows Subsystem` for `Linux` along with the latest `Ubuntu` distribution available from the `Microsoft Store`. If you already have `WSL` installed but want to upgrade or change your `Linux` distribution, you can manually select it from the `Microsoft Store`.

**2. Install `Ubuntu` Distribution:**

-   Go to the `Microsoft Store` and search for `Ubuntu`
-   Install the latest version of `Ubuntu` (e.g., `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` or `Ubuntu 22.04 LTS`)

**3. Open the `Ubuntu` Terminal:**

-   Once installed, open the `Ubuntu` terminal from the Start menu

**4. Update and Install `CDO`:**

-   In the `Ubuntu` terminal, update your package list:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sudo apt update
```

-   Install `CDO` using the package manager:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sudo apt install cdo
```

-   Enter your password when prompted

**5. Verify the Installation:**

-   To verify that `CDO` is installed, type:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cdo --version
```

This command will display the installed version of `CDO`
:::

::: callout-important
-   `Windows Subsystem for Linux 2` provides a full `Linux` kernel and better performance. If you're using an older version, you might want to upgrade to `WSL 2` by following instructions on the [WSL 2 documentation page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

-   The `Ubuntu` terminal has seamless access to your `Windows` file system, so you can use `CDO` on files stored on your Windows drives directly

## `ncview`: a `netCDF` visual browser

`ncview` is a fast and user-friendly visual browser for exploring `netCDF` files. Mainly designed for `Linux` and `macOS`, `ncview` provides an intuitive interface to quickly view and analyze the contents of any `netCDF` file, making it a convenient tool for data exploration and preliminary analysis.

::: callout-tip
## installing `ncview`

**1. Open the `Terminal` and type:**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sudo port install ncview
```

**2. Verify the Installation:**

-   To verify that `ncview` is installed, type:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ncview --version
```

This command will display the installed version of `ncview`
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## `ncview` for `Windows`?

`ncview` is designed for Unix-like environments (`Linux` and `macOS`). However, the installation can be achieved by using `Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)`:

**1. Install `Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)`:**

-   Open `PowerShell` as Administrator and run:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
wsl --install
```

-   This command installs `WSL` along with a default `Linux` distribution, such as `Ubuntu.` If you already have `WSL`, make sure it is set to `version 2` by running:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

**2. Install Packages:**

-   Open the `Ubuntu` terminal (or your chosen `Linux` distribution) and update your package list:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sudo apt update
```

-   Install the required dependencies for `ncview`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sudo apt install ncview
```

**3. Verify the Installation:**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ncview
```

-   This should start `ncview` if the installation was successful

**4. `X server (VcXsrv)` for `ncview`**

-   Download and install `VcXsrv` from [official GitHub releases page](https://github.com/ArcticaProject/vcxsrv/releases)
-   Launch `VcXsrv` after installation
-   Set the DISPLAY Environment Variable in `WSL`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
export DISPLAY=$(grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | awk '{print $2}'):0.0
```

## Working with CDO and ncview

For the purpose of this workshop and to demonstrate how to use `CDO (Climate Data Operators)` and `ncview`, I have included two `netCDF` files of **dynamical fronts** (i.e., FSLE - Finite Size Lyapunov Exponent) in the workshop repository you have already cloned. These files are located in the `data_raw/2016 directory`.

To work with `CDO` and `ncview`, you'll need to use the terminal command line. Open the `Ubuntu` app in `Windows` or the `Terminal` on `macOS.`

::: callout-tip
## `CDO` and `ncview` from the terminal command line

**1.1 Data Directory**

-   In your command line, type:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cd /Users/ibrito/Desktop/NACECC_workshop/data_raw/2016/

# Navigate to the directory where you have stored the workshop repository
# Note: The path below is specific to my local computer. Please replace it with your own directory path
```

-   This command sets `NACECC_workshop` as your primary working directory

**1.2 Windows Users**

-   If your workshop repository is located on the `Desktop`, the path should be within the `/mnt/c/Users/YourUsername/Desktop/` directory

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cd /mnt/c/Users/YourUsername/Desktop/NACECC_workshop/data_raw/2016/
# Replace YourUsername with your actual Windows username.
```

**2. Viewing Data with `ncview`**

-   Check if your data file is in the directory by listing the files:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ls -l
# This command will display the contents of the data directory
```

-   To quickly view the `netCDF` file using `ncview`, type:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ncview dt_global_allsat_madt_fsle_20160601_20210921.nc
```

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/ncview_01.png")
```

-   In `Windows` remember to run first:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
export DISPLAY=$(grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | awk '{print $2}'):0.0
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ncview dt_global_allsat_madt_fsle_20160601_20210921.nc
```

**3. File Details with `CDO`**

-   To inspect the metadata and structure of the `netCDF` file using `CDO`, type:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cdo -sinfo dt_global_allsat_madt_fsle_20160601_20210921.nc
# This command provides detailed information about the file, such as variable names, dimensions, and attributes.
```

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/cdo_01.png")
```

The model details are:

-   Horizontal component: resolution 9000x4500 (\~4km)
-   Vertical component: 1 level (i.e., surface)
-   Time component: 1 step

**4. Check variable(s) name**

-   To get the variable names from a `netCDF` file using `CDO`, you can use the `showname` function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cdo showname dt_global_allsat_madt_fsle_20160601_20210921.nc
```

The model variables are: `fsle_max` `theta_max`[@sudre2023a]

## Ocean Front dataset: AVISO product

For the primary purpose of this workshop, we will use AVISO products, primarily focusing on ocean fronts. AVISO is the French Active Archive Data Center for multi-satellite altimeter missions. It is responsible for post-processing, analyzing, archiving, and distributing altimetry data for CNES (Centre National d'Études Spatiales), the French Space Agency.

You can set up an account and start downloading datasets for your research. Visit the website here: <https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr>

::: callout-note
I strongly recommend downloading the data via `FTP` to simplify your workflow. You can use FTP clients such as `WinSCP`, `FileZilla`, or `MobaXterm`.
:::

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/aviso_01.png")
```

### Dynamical fronts: **Finite-size lyapunov exponent (FSLE)**

In simple terms, the **Finite-size Lyapunov Exponent (FSLE)** is a tool used to understand how the ocean moves and mixes. FSLE helps identify lines in the ocean that act like barriers or pathways. High FSLE values highlight lines that act as transport barriers (known as Lagrangian coherent structures), which help identify features like filaments, fronts, or eddy boundaries.

More information on these aspects, please read [@sudre2023]

### Thermal fronts

Thermal fronts are typically derived from remotely sensed sea surface temperature (SST) data. While this eBook does not cover this specific type of data, calculating thermal fronts is essentially based on estimating `thermal gradients`. In the `R` package `terra`, you can estimate the `thermal gradient` on any `raster` by simply using the `slope` argument in the `terra::terrain()` function. This approach allows you to identify areas where the temperature changes rapidly over space, in which high values corresponds to `thermal fronts`.

::: callout-tip
## thermal fronts calculation

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "40%", eval = FALSE}
library(terra)

# Read the raster stack of sea surface temperature (SST) from the NOAA product at 0.25 degrees resolution
rs <- rast("data_raw/thermal_rs/oisst-avhrr-v02r01_19832000_mmean.tif")

# Plot the first layer of the raster stack to visually check the data
plot(rs, 1)
```

```{r, out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE,  fig.align = "center"}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/boa_01.png")
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, out.width = "40%", eval = FALSE}
# Calculate the slope (thermal gradient) for the first layer of the SST data
slp <- terra::terrain(subset(rs, 1), "slope")

# Plot the calculated slope to visually inspect the result
plot(slp)
```

```{r, out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE,  fig.align = "center"}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/boa_02.png")
```

### Procesing FSLE data from AVISO (or any other climate data)

You do not actually have to download the front dataset from `AVISO` at this point. We will use the dataset located in the workshop repository that you have previously `cloned`.

::: callout-tip
## `NACECC_workshop_repo`

-   **Go** to the location where you `cloned` the repository
-   **Open** the `NACECC_workshop_repo.Rproj` file
-   This process should open a new `R session` in `RStudio` and, by default, set the `NACECC_workshop_repo` as the working directory, with relative paths

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/repo_00.png")
```
:::

The `AVISO` dataset on fronts consists of individual daily files of `140 MB` each, covering the period from `1994 — 2023`. You can imagine that processing these files in `R` could be quite challenging. `R` will need to use **YOUR** local memory just to read these files, and any additional tasks we need to perform (such as `aggregating`, `merging`, calculating `averages`, `minimums`, `maximums`, etc.) will also rely on your local computer's internal memory.

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/aviso_03.png")
```

::: callout-note
## Example 1: Using `CDO` to merge files

This is the structure of the `NACECC_workshop_repo` repository that we have `cloned`. I did not include all the `AVISO` files; as an example, we will work with only 2 files. You can repeat the same exercise with however many files you have for your projects.

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/repo_01.png")
```

To better handle front or any other climate data, organizing the dataset by `year` or `month` is the way to go. In fact, the `IPCC` data structure typically works with monthly files (and sometimes yearly files).

Using `CDO` to merge files is simple. We will have to use `-mergetime` operator in the directory. For example, using the `terminal` or the `RStudio terminal tab`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Navigate to the directory where the front data is stored
cd data_raw/2016/

# Check how many NetCDF files are in the directory
ls -l *.nc

# Combine the two NetCDF files
cdo -mergetime *.nc combined_file.nc
```

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/merge_01.png")
```

The CDO Syntax is very simple. It requieres:

-   `cdo` `-Operator` `input_files` `output_files`

From the code before we can see:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Specify the operator for merging files
Operator == "-mergetime" 

# Define the input files (using wildcard * to identify all .nc files in the directory)
input_files == "*.nc" 

# Define the output file name (make sure to include the extension)
output_files == "combined_file.nc"
```
:::

::: callout-note
## Example 2: Check the new file and plot it using `ncview`

To check the structure of the new `combined_file.nc` file, we will use the `-sinfo` operator. In the same directorty `data_raw/2016/`, type (using the `terminal` or the `RStudio terminal tab`):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cdo -sinfo combined_file.nc
```

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics("images/merge_02.png")
```

To quickly plot the new `combined_file.nc` using `ncview`, type:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ncview combined_file.nc
```

## Exploring Useful CDO Functions

`CDO` provides a wide range of functions for processing and analyzing climate data in `netCDF` format. Below are some of the most commonly used functions, along with additional operators that can be useful for specific tasks.

::: callout-tip
## `CDO` Functions

**1. Commonly Used**

-   `cdo -yearmean`: Calculates the `annual mean` from a monthly data input `netCDF` file
-   `cdo -yearmin`: Calculates the `annual minimum` from a monthly data input `netCDF` file
-   `cdo -yearmax`: Calculates the `annual maximum` from a monthly data input `netCDF` file
-   `cdo -ensmean`: Computes the `ensemble mean` across multiple `netCDF` files. This is particularly useful when you have input files from - different models and want to calculate the `mean` across all models
-   `cdo -vertmean`: Calculates the `vertical mean` for `netCDF` files with ocean levels (e.g., depth)
-   `cdo -mergetime`: Merges all `netCDF` files in your directory into a single file, combining data over time

**2. Additional Operators**

-   `cdo sellonlatbox,170,-170,-10,-30 input_file.nc output_file.nc`: Selects a specific region within the data, defined by the longitude and latitude box (in this case, from 170° to -170° longitude and from -10° to -30° latitude)
-   `cdo -remapbil,r1440x720 -select,name=thetao input_file.nc output_file.nc`: Performs bilinear interpolation to remap the data to a 1440x720 grid, selecting the variable thetao (temperature at depth).
-   `cdo -remapdis,r1440x720 -select,name=thetao input_file.nc output_file.nc`: Performs distance-weighted interpolation to remap the data to a 1440x720 grid, selecting the variable thetao.
-   `cdo -remapbil,r4000x2000 -select,name=fsle input_file.nc output_file.nc`: Performs bilinear interpolation to remap the data to a 4000x2000 grid, selecting the variable fsle (Finite-size Lyapunov Exponent)
